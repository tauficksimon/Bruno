_Repo note (2026-07-13): this is Bruno's canonical tool roadmap, moved in from the
owner's notes. The "Now" section matches the tools implemented in
`src/agents/outboundAgent.ts`. The remaining sections map to the unified roadmap in
`infrastructure-plan.md` §7: Reply Ops → Phase B1–B5 · Campaign Control → B2/D2 ·
Lead Scoring/Acquisition → B7 · CRM/Instantly State → C1 · Metrics/Analytics →
A10/C3 · Deliverability → A11/D1 · Learning → C2–C4 · Ops/Safety → A4/A12/B6._

_2026-07-14: `get_lead_history` (from the CRM section's `get_lead`/`get_conversation_thread`/`list_lead_activity` trio) is now implemented in the "Now" set — full per-lead dossier as a tool._
